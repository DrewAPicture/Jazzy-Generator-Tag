# Jazzy Generator Tag

This WordPress plugin supplements your site's 'generator' tag with the jazz artist your current version of WordPress was named after.

For instance, if you're running WordPress 4.5, the generator tag value in your site's source will be replaced with 'WordPress 4.5 to the sounds of Coleman Hawkins'.
